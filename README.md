WTFMut has been retooled for total compatibility with ServerPerks!


This edition relies on three mutators:

1. Server Veterancy Handler V7 by Marco <https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?threads/mut-per-server-stats.36898/>
2. Default Equipment Replacer by Beeeeees
3. Boss Replacer by Beeeeees

Nothing is locked behind a mutator anymore, so you're free to combine any/all WTF classes you
want available on your server, and can configure waves however you desire using the KFGameType
section of KillingFloor.ini (a sample KFGameType section is provided in the '.\sample configuration files' folder)

Note that some special functions of WTF items for non-WTF Perks, but any class can use them normally.

Boss Replacer and Default Equipment Replacer can be used to specify whatever boss class or starting equipment
classes you want to use - with or without WTFMut classes (items, perks). Fellow modders, go nuts!

Source Code for everything I made is included - feel free to change whatever you want, BUT YOU MUST RENAME THE MOD
AND CREDIT ME FOR THE WORK I DID. Renaming the mod to WTFMut-JasonAwesomeEditionV5.u and adding a little one-line
comment like "original WTFMut by BEEEEEES" would be fine.

If you find any bugs - please post them to <https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?threads/kf-wtfmut-betabees.45557/>
